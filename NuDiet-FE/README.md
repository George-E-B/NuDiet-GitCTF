# NuDiet-FE
This is made using JavaScript so installing npm is neccesary, you can use this link to do this: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm 

When Node.js and npm are installed, clone the project and cd into it.

To run the frontend:

1/ cd into my_app folder with "cd .\NuDiet-FE\my-app\"

2/ To install all the dependancies run "npm install", if you receive errors run "npm install --force"

3/ You can now start the server using "npm start"
